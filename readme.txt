**How Portfolio Manager works - The workflow**

It is pretty easy to create a beautiful portfolio list or a gallery. It is all done in the plugin interface with zero coding requirement. 

The short version is: 

* Upload portfolio items
* Create lists
* Display the lists wherever you need them

Bellow we go in a little more details.

First you need to upload your portfolio/gallery items. Each item is a separate post similar to the default WordPress posts. You can fill in variety of options for each portfolio posts: title, description, short description, details, upload media, and choose categories and tags.

Once you have uploaded your portfolio items you can create lists with them:

* Choose a template 
* Select the portfolio items to display
* Modify the layout by using the settings for your list
* Add some custom styling via the custom css field, if needed.

Once you have a list created you can display it wherever you need: your pages, your template files, your sidebars as a widget.

There is no limit for the number of portfolio items or lists you can create. Have as many as you need.

**Templates**

This plugin comes with 8 templates to choose from. Once you select a template then you can customize it however you want.

* Grid - Portfolio 1 col
* Grid - Portfolio 4 col
* Image Left - Portfolio 1 column
* Newspaper - Portfolio 3 columns
* Widget Style - Image Left
* Timeline
* Slider 
* Carousel 3 columns


**Select and re-arrange list item's content**

For each portfolio list you can choose to show or hide the following content. You can also re-arrange it. It is all drag and drop, easy!

* Title
* Media
* Portfolio item details
* Excerpt text
* Continue reading

**Single portfolio items**

Portfolio items are well organized in a portfolio custom post type, categories, tags and item details. Use the Media Left template or the default theme's post template to present your portfolio post items.

**Media Types**

Select media types for your portfolio items / posts:

* Image
* Slider
* Youtube
* Vimeo
* Soundcloud

Images are optimized to save your hosting storage. Do not worry, quality stays as the original image you have uploaded.


**Add a list in your site**

Once you have created a portfolio list you can add it everywhere in your site:

* In page/post content area (WYSIWYG editor)
* In template files
* In a sidebar

Every list has a shortcode you can use to add the list in a page/post content area. Or add it in a template file by using the do_shortcode WordPress function. The plugin comes with a widget that can be used to add portfolio posts list in a sidebar.

Style your list using the Custom CSS class name.
